What is framework ? (Backbone of Automation)

Time-Saving
Avoid confusion
Reusability

Guideliness:
coding Standards - naming convention, Indent spacing
Excel - Input and output
Folder Structure
Test results
Role and responsibilities


Selenium with Java - TestNG, Behaviour driven development, JUnit
Selenium with C# - NUnit, Datadriven framework, Modular driven, Hybrid

Modular Framework : (Code + Data)

Advantages:
Code Reusability

insert Order - Login , insert, logout 
Update order - Login , search, update, logout
Delete Order - Login , search, delete, logout

Login, Logout, Search

Folder-Structure:
project_Modular_framework -> test Scripts
project_Modular_framework -> Function Library
project_Modular_framework -> Tests results


Adv
1) reusability
2) script maintenance

Disadv
1) Analyze - Code reusability 
2) technical Expertize
3) Data Reusability - Test Input


Datadriven :
Code -> Separate
Data -> Separate

M1 -> Datables
M2 -> Excel 
M3 -> Generating a sheet


project_datadriven_framework -> test Scripts
project_datadriven_framework -> Function Library
project_datadriven_framework -> Tests results
project_datadriven_framework -> Test Data

Scenario 1: Login to gmail and open first mail  - 3 
Scenario 2: Login to Yahoo and open the subject as in the Excel  - 4
Scenario 3: Login to Facebook and open a friend's wall. Friend's name is mentioned in the Excel - 7

Columname : url, username, password, EmailSubject, Friend's Name

Without Iterations - All are in the same Worksheet
With Iterations - ALl should be in different Sheets


Hybrid Framework:

Combining more than one framework

NUnit
------
It is a unit testing framework
